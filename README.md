# Web-Scraping-Python

        This Project contains the web scraping code of "IMDB Top 250 movie ratings" from IMDB website and Job Listing code for "Software Developer" jobs in "Miami, FL" from SimplyHired.com.
        I used Python's BeautifulSoup Library and there is only less data cleaning since the data is already cleaned.
